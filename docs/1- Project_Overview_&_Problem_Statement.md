# Project Overview & Problem Statement

## Project Overview
This project is a cross-platform application built using the Flet framework. It aims to provide a responsive, modern interface integrating an emerging technology layer while maintaining accessible and modular design. The app demonstrates essential features such as navigation, authentication, UI components, and simple data handling.

## Problem Statement
Many student developers struggle with building cross-platform applications due to complex frameworks and fragmented tooling. This project addresses that problem by using Flet—an emerging technology that allows Flutter-style UI development directly in Python—making it easier to build, test, and deploy apps without deep mobile development knowledge.
