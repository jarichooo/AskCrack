# Project Overview & Problem Statement

## Project Overview
CrackTify is a desktop application built using the Flet framework with mobile application scalability, which allows Flutter-style UI development directly in Python. The app provides a responsive, modern interface that integrates emerging technology while maintaining accessible and modular design. It demonstrates essential features such as navigation, authentication, UI components, and simple data handling.

## Problem Statement
Structural engineers and building inspectors face persistent challenges in ensuring the safety of commercial buildings due to the limitations of traditional inspection methods. Manual visual inspection is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error—especially when dealing with poor lighting, uneven surfaces, or subtle surface cracks that can easily be overlooked. Research indicates that early-stage cracks, if undetected, can worsen over time, compromising structural integrity and potentially endangering occupants.

Despite advancements in automation and digital tools, there remains a lack of accessible, user-friendly software tailored specifically for accurate crack detection using image processing. Inspectors often rely on raw photographs without enhanced visualization tools, and engineers lack automated support to quickly analyze potential structural issues. This gap makes it difficult to identify defects early, generate consistent reports, and maintain reliable documentation for safety assessments.

CrackTify addresses this need by providing a standalone desktop application capable of analyzing uploaded images using OpenCV-based edge detection algorithms (Sobel and Scharr). The system aims to assist inspectors in detecting wall cracks more efficiently and help engineers assess their severity. However, to function effectively, the system requires a robust design that ensures accurate image verification, fast processing, intuitive interface navigation, secure handling of user data, and reliable visualization of detected cracks.

The problem, therefore, is to design and implement a software solution that automates crack detection from uploaded images while maintaining high accuracy, usability, and stability—ultimately enabling earlier identification of structural issues and supporting safer building maintenance practices.
