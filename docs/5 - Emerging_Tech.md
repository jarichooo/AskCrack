# Emerging Technology Explanation & Limitations

## 1. What Emerging Technology We Used
Our project uses **Flet**, a relatively new emerging framework that allows developers to build real-time, cross-platform applications using Python while generating Flutter UI components. Flet is considered an emerging technology because it is modern, still evolving, and introduces a new approach to creating mobile and desktop apps without needing to use Dart or complex native SDKs.

## 2. How We Used This Emerging Technology in the Project
We used Flet as the core UI development framework for our application. It handled:
- Page navigation (Welcome, Login, Register, OTP, Main Page)
- Loading UI controls such as text fields, buttons, containers, rows, and columns
- Implementing responsive layouts
- Managing user interaction events and state updates
- Structuring the app using Python instead of Flutter/Dart

By using Flet, the entire app—frontend and logic—was developed using only Python, demonstrating how emerging tools can simplify multi-platform development.

## 3. Limitations of the Emerging Technology
Although Flet is powerful, it has several limitations:
- The framework is still new and less stable than mature UI libraries
- Limited documentation and fewer online examples
- Smaller community and fewer third-party widgets
- Some UI components behave differently across platforms
- Performance is not yet equal to native Flutter apps

Despite these limitations, Flet significantly helped us build a functional UI rapidly and served as our project's required emerging technology.
