Throughout the development of CrackTify, I took on a few roles that challenged and enriched myself. At the frontend, I merely focused on improving the user experience by fixing few issues in the profile page, like debugging UI inconsistencies and an UI appearance feature.

In addition to coding, I also served somewhat as the Documentary Head, maintaining with the best of my abilities a comprehensive project documentation such as technical specifications and user guides to ensure clear communication.

As a Scrum Manager, facilitating agile processes like daily stand-ups and sprint planning to keep the team aligned.

Although the project was challenging—with technical hurdles in ML-UI integration and team coordination—the experience was rewarding. The combination of problem-solving, leadership, and seeing our cross-platform crack detection app materialize made the hard work worthwhile. This project enhanced my technical and management skills significantly.
